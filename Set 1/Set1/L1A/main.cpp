// The include section adds extra definitions from the C++ standard library.
#include <iostream> // For cin, cout, etc.

// We will (most of the time) use the standard library namespace in our programs.
using namespace std;

// Must have a function named "main", which is the starting point of a C++ program.

    /******** INSERT YOUR CODE ABOVE HERE ********/
